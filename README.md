Distance Sensor Control Application
This project is a distance sensor control application developed using C++ and Arduino on embedded systems.

Features:
Distance Measurement: Real-time distance measurement using an ultrasonic sensor.
Arduino Integration: Reading and processing sensor data with an Arduino microcontroller.
Data Processing: Analyzing sensor data and implementing decision-making based on specific conditions.
Output Control: Controlling components like LEDs, buzzers, or motors based on measured distances.
Optimized Coding: Modular and readable code structure that efficiently utilizes limited embedded system resources.
This application demonstrates the potential of embedded systems by simplifying distance measurement and peripheral device control.
